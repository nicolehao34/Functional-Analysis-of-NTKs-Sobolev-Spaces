**Functional Analysis of Neural Tangent Kernels in Sobolev Networks for Operator Learning**  
Operator Learning in Sobolev Spaces via Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs)
---

## Overview  
This project bridges **functional analysis**, **neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory**, and **operator learning** to rigorously analyze how deep neural networks approximate nonlinear operators between Sobolev spaces. The goal is to characterize the interplay between neural network architecture, optimization dynamics, and approximation error in high-dimensional function spaces, with applications to learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).  

Key themes:  
- **Mathematical Framework**: Sobolev spaces, neural tangent kernels, and operator-valued RKHS.  
- **Theoretical Insights**: Approximation bounds, spectral bias, and optimization guarantees.  
- **Numerical Validation**: PDE case studies (e.g., Burgersâ€™ equation) with error analysis.

## Scope  
### 1. **Theoretical Contributions**  
- **Operator Approximation**: Prove universal approximation theorems for neural networks mapping between Sobolev spaces \( H^s(D) \to H^t(D') \).  
- **NTK Analysis**: Derive spectral properties of the neural tangent kernel for operator learning and link its eigendecomposition to Sobolev-space error rates.  
- **Error Bounds**: Establish scaling laws for network depth/width and their impact on generalization in Sobolev norms.  

### 2. **Numerical Experiments**  
- **Burgers Equation**: Learn the operator mapping initial conditions to PDE solutions.  
- **NTK Eigenanalysis**: Quantify spectral decay of the NTK and its correlation with Sobolev errors.  
- **Width/Depth Scaling**: Validate theoretical depth-width-error tradeoffs.  

### 3. **Applications**  
- Scientific machine learning (SciML) tasks like PDE surrogate modeling.  
- Cross-domain transfer learning for function-to-function regression.
